# Devshroom Club – Website Frontend

This project is a **simple and clean frontend website** built for the Devshroom university tech club. It was developed as part of a **summer project that lasted only 3 days**, with the goal of quickly delivering a functional and polished frontend.

My role in this project was focused solely on building the **frontend using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The backend and content sections were left for the club to complete later.


> 🛠️ Note: The club will complete the missing content sections such as workshop descriptions.
